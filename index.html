              I graduated university with a degree in Political Science and a
              minor in Constitutional Law. After I graduated, my plan was to
              attend Law School. However, having done internships and worked in
              the court systems I realized that perhaps becoming a lawyer may
              not be the path I want to go with at the moment.

              I am currently enrolled in the Thinkful coding bootcamp in their
              Engineering Immersion program. I am currently located near Atlanta
              Georgia which is just 20 minutes away from me.

            <p>
              Coding has always been very interesting for me. Before I choose
              Political Science as my major I was a Computer Science major
              first. What was interesting most to me was the how intricate the
              world of coding is and the vast amount of possibilities coding can
              be used for.
            </p>

              With the guidance of the team at Thinkful, I plan to have a
              successful carrer working with code. It is, however, very
              challenging but I am positive with hard work, dedication, and
              guidance I can overcome these obstacles and create cool stuff with
              other like-minded individuals.
